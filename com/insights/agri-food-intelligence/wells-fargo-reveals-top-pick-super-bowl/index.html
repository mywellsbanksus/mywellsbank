</p> <p><img src="../../../../../www17.wellsfargomedia.com/assets/images/commercial/insights/agri-food-intelligence/articles/super-bowl-AdobeStock_127295137-720x300.jpg" alt=""/></p> <p>The 2024 Super Bowl celebration should be lively and relatively affordable compared to recent years. Expect packed grocery stores, restaurants, and sports bars, which may require you to bring your best game to those venues. Why the rush? Credit it to a touchdown in job growth.</p> <p>U.S. companies hired approximately 2.4 million more workers in January 2024, compared to January 2023.<sup class="c20ref" data-footnote="tcm:84-265905-16" type="footnote"></sup> As competition for labor remains fierce, the average wage growth rose by 4.5% from the same period last year (this translates to $1.28 more per hour, bringing the average hourly pay to $29.57 per hour).<sup class="c20ref" data-footnote="tcm:84-265905-16" type="footnote"></sup> </p> <p>While wage growth has been impressive, consumers are still facing off against the tough opponent of food inflation. Inflation for food consumed at home has risen least, up 1.3% from January of 2023,<sup class="c20ref" data-footnote="tcm:84-265906-16" type="footnote"></sup> while food consumed away from home is still on a tear, clocking a 5.3% increase from January of 2023.<sup class="c20ref" data-footnote="tcm:84-265906-16" type="footnote"></sup> So, it’s likely that the economics coach will be calling upon home chefs to get in the game with this matchup.</p> <p>Now let’s break down the roster of expected food and beverage superstars and support players for the big game.</p> <h2>Wing route</h2> <p>Wings remain a great option. Based on early January 2024 data, fresh and frozen chicken wings are averaging $3.26 and $3.17 respectively per lb.<sup class="c20ref" data-footnote="tcm:84-265907-16" type="footnote"></sup> Fresh chicken wing prices are down approximately 5%, and the frozen wing prices are down 11%,<sup class="c20ref" data-footnote="tcm:84-265907-16" type="footnote"></sup> compared to January of 2023. It was a turbulent year for the chicken industry, with high feed costs and outbreaks of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) challenging producers. Even so, producers rallied, producing more and heavier chickens, to ensure adequate supply for the big game.</p> <h2>Cattle City beefs</h2> <p>The cost of beef reflects its short supply relative to other options. Record low cattle numbers have led to record high retail prices. While prices have eased from these highs, they are still at a substantial increase over beef prices for the 2023 Super Bowl. Beef is always a party winner, but this high draft pick will cost consumers more than ever, so it will pay to shop around if you plan to include beef on the menu.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Sirloin steak</strong> remains an all-star for any celebration. The four-week average through early January 2024 was $9.35 per lb., up 2.3% from January 2023.<sup class="c20ref" data-footnote="tcm:84-265907-16" type="footnote"></sup> Retailers report that consumers are more enthusiastic about buying steak when the package price is under $10.00 per pound.<sup class="c20ref" data-footnote="tcm:84-307424-16" type="footnote"></sup></li> <li><strong>Ground beef</strong> prices are showing signs of improvement for the consumer but are still up considerably from a year ago as we prepare for the big game. The most recent four-week average from early January 2024 showed prices as high as $4.25 per lb.,<sup class="c20ref" data-footnote="tcm:84-265907-16" type="footnote"></sup> up nearly 12% from the same time last year. Hopefully, the improvement in employment and wages will be enough to keep this key player in the game.</li> </ul> <h2>Line of shrimp-age</h2> <p>Shrimp looks like it could line up as an eligible receiver for the celebration. The most recent four-week average saw fresh shrimp averaging $8.84 per lb.,<sup class="c20ref" data-footnote="tcm:84-265907-16" type="footnote"></sup> down 6.4% from early January 2023. Global producers flaunted strong production, and they are looking for the U.S. consumer to get in the game by grilling more shrimp or preparing a shrimp ceviche.  </p> <h2>Special teams coverage: chips and dips</h2> <p>Just as big ads and even bigger half-time shows are a must for the Super Bowl, chips and dips are an absolute must for watch parties. This category highlights the issue of paying for a name. While commodity categories have seen faster slowdowns or outright declines, items with major brand names have seen steeper increases.  </p> <ul> <li><strong>Tortilla chips</strong> are up 6% as of the end of December 2023 when compared to December 2022.<sup class="c20ref" data-footnote="tcm:84-307425-16" type="footnote"></sup> This represents the long tail to the food supply disruption of the last several years. The tide is just about run out on this phenomenon, but the consumer will still have to deal with the last of it.</li> <li><strong>Potato chips</strong> are up 5% as of the end of December 2023 compared to December 2022.<sup class="c20ref" data-footnote="tcm:84-307425-16" type="footnote"></sup> Potato and tortilla chips are close cousins in the food aisles, with labor and packaging being big factors in their costs. This might be the year to try alternative labels which are out there fighting for consumer business.</li> <li><strong>Avocado dip and guacamole</strong> prices have remained fairly flat, up just 1% from at the end of December 2023 compared to December 2022.<sup class="c20ref" data-footnote="tcm:84-307425-16" type="footnote"></sup> This category benefitted from the continuing supply growth in the key Mexican growing region. The raw materials cost has helped to offset the other labor and packaging costs.</li> <li><strong>Salsa</strong> prices are up 3% comparing end of December 2023 to December 2022.<sup class="c20ref" data-footnote="tcm:84-307425-16" type="footnote"></sup> This category continues the theme of Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG) prices rising to reflect the labor and packaging. Here again, the consumer should shop carefully for alternative brands they might have previously overlooked. Often times, store brands and local producers are more apt to offer a value for the Super Bowl shopper.</li> </ul> <h2>Beverage blitz</h2> <p>The cooler is an important player at this yearly blowout celebration. Let’s check to see who should be starting in the big game and who might be on the injured reserve list.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Beer</strong> prices were up 0.7% at the end of December 2023 compared to a year previous, averaging $1.75 for a pint.<sup class="c20ref" data-footnote="tcm:84-307427-16" type="footnote"></sup> The most recent data shows beer prices beginning to flatten out with very small increases as brewers and consumers seem to have come to an agreement on the new price of this beverage.</li> <li><strong>Soft drink</strong> pricing has placed focus on the wide gap between the price for single cans and 2-liter bottles. Late December 2023 data showed soft drinks in a 12-ounce can priced at $0.57, up 4.8% from year end 2022.<sup class="c20ref" data-footnote="tcm:84-307427-16" type="footnote"></sup>  In contrast, the same soft drinks in a 2-liter bottle carried a price of $2.11, down 0.8% from December 2022.<sup class="c20ref" data-footnote="tcm:84-307427-16" type="footnote"></sup> The price differential has been driven by the cost of aluminum coupled with the consumer preference for the convenience of single cans. It should be noted that soft drinks as a category have seen the highest food inflation spike since the start of COVID in 2020 – with the 12-ounce can category up 57% and the 2-liter bottle category having increased by 33% since that time.</li> </ul> <p>Whether hosting a party at home or dining out with friends to view this year’s Super Bowl, consumers have options to avoid getting sidelined due to increasing costs. Cheers to a competitive, enjoyable, and delicious game!</p>
