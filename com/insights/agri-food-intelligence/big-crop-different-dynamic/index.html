 </p> <p>Grain and oilseeds are the most important, and yield the highest revenue, of all U.S. agricultural crops marketed globally.<sup class="c20ref" data-footnote="tcm:84-323100-16" type="footnote"></sup> These crops impact every aspect of the food system from the cost of feed to the cost of the inputs to grow them. Since the start of COVID in the spring of 2020, grain and oilseeds have moved through a major price cycle.<sup class="c20ref" data-footnote="tcm:84-323101-16" type="footnote"></sup> The main catalyst for the price dynamics was the Russian invasion of Ukraine, creating serious concerns about the supply from these two major exporters. However, ultimately, Ukraine and Russia have continued to supply the market better than the initial expectations. In addition, key exporters like Brazil, Argentina, Canada and Australia took the opportunity to expand acreage and production of these crops.  </p> <p>As shown in the chart below, there was a minor decline in the 2022 production of grain and oilseeds, but the 2023 and 2024 crops have been more than adequate to eliminate the supply risk premium.<sup class="c20ref" data-footnote="tcm:84-323102-16" type="footnote"></sup></p> <p><img src="../../../../../www17.wellsfargomedia.com/assets/images/commercial/insights/agri-food-intelligence/articles/SwansonBlog-Chart1-GlobalGrainOilseed-720px.jpg" alt="Line graph depicts global grain and oilseed production in billions of metric tons between the 2012/2013 crop season up to the 2024/2025 projected crop season.  Growth has trended slightly upward across the period ranging from 2.69 billion metric tons in 2012/2013 to 3.42 billion metric tons forecasted in the current growing season"/> <br /></p> <p><img src="../../../../../www17.wellsfargomedia.com/assets/images/commercial/insights/agri-food-intelligence/articles/SwansonBlog-Chart2-CornCashPrice-720px.jpg" alt="Line graph depicting the national corn price per bushel from January 1, 2020 through mid-2024.  Trend line shows a steady increase up to the all-time high of $7.38 per bushel in mid 2022 when it then began to steadily trend downward.  Corn was at $4.48 per bushel in June of 2024."/> <br /></p> <p>The grain and soybean price cycle, precipitated by the Russia/Ukraine conflict, sent major shockwaves through the U.S. food system. At the same time that labor and  transportation costs, resulting from COVID disruptions were also driving prices higher. Using the Iowa State University data, the cost of feeding a hog for sale rose from $72 in September of 2020 to $131 in June of 2022. It has since declined to $94 per head as of June of 2024, and will continue to decline as the lower price of corn and feeds works its way through the system.<sup class="c20ref" data-footnote="tcm:84-323104-16" type="footnote"></sup> At its peak price, feed accounted for 66% of the total cost to send a hog to market.<sup>4</sup></p> <p><img src="../../../../../www17.wellsfargomedia.com/assets/images/commercial/insights/agri-food-intelligence/articles/SwansonBlog-Chart3-HogFeed-720px.jpg" alt="Line chart illustrating the changing feed cost for a hog for sale between 2020 and 2022 whereby feeding a hog for sale rose from $72 in September of 2020 to $131 in June of 2022. Costs have since begun to decline and were at $94 per head as of June 2024."/> <br /></p> <p>This same cost dynamic is working through all the proteins with similar impacts. According to the USDA, 77% of the variable cost of milk is feed cost, and feed accounts for 51% of the total cost of milk.<sup class="c20ref" data-footnote="tcm:84-323105-16" type="footnote"></sup> While poultry and beef production have different cost shares, feed costs are always the single largest factor in total production.</p> <p>With the significant drop in feed costs and their direct impact on the cost of production, should the consumer expect price relief at the supermarket and at restaurants? The answer is yes, but they need to expect it to be slow and muted by many complicating competitive factors.<sup class="c20ref" data-footnote="tcm:84-323107-16" type="footnote"></sup> </p> <p>The following chart shows the price for the three major proteins at the retail level beginning in 2020. None of the retail prices moved up immediately, with the exception of beef which also dropped back sharply. Many of the livestock operators and processors suffered compressed margins as they passed along double-digit cost increases with single-digit price increases. The drop in feed costs will lower the cost of production and encourage additional supply competition through improved margins. However, this will not completely offset the increased labor costs that the entire supply chain has built into its structure. The flipside is that wage increases help consumers pay for the higher retail prices which will keep them elevated. No one feels good about the idea of higher wages offsetting price increases, but the strong demand in terms of consumption demonstrates significant impact.</p> <p><img src="../../../../../www17.wellsfargomedia.com/assets/images/commercial/insights/agri-food-intelligence/articles/SwansonBlog-Chart4-MeatPrices-720px.jpg" alt="Line graph depicting the retail price of the three most popular meats – Beef, Pork, and Chicken – between January 2020 and June 2024.  Prices are represented in cents per pound.  Beef has increased from 606 cents per lb. to 812 cents per pound.  Pork has increased from 384 cents per pound to 488 cents per lb. and chicken has shown the least increase from 187 cents per pound to 240 cents per pound."/> <br /></p> <p>The drop in crop prices will work backwards in the supply chain as well. The University of Minnesota’s Center for Farm Financial Management database calculated the total cost of production for cash rent corn in 2023 at $4.98 per bushel, and total cost of production for soybean at $11.60 per bushel.<sup class="c20ref" data-footnote="tcm:84-323108-16" type="footnote"></sup> The recent drop in CME futures prices shows corn at $3.99 per bushel in December, and soybeans at $10.16 for November.<sup class="c20ref" data-footnote="tcm:84-323109-16" type="footnote"></sup> With a cash price that is more often below the quoted future’s price, farmers will be losing money on every bushel they sell. Higher yields should help reduce the cost of production, but it will not be enough to offset the large drop in prices. There is not much farmers can do about this year’s cost structure. They agree to cash rents, fertilizer, seed, and equipment costs well in advance of planting the crop, and most of them do little price risk management through hedging. Losses from this year’s crop will eat into their strong financial position from the previous three years, thus reducing financial liquidity.</p> <p>The USDA’s initial estimate of net farm income released in February, before the drop in crop prices, had anticipated some of the negative development. The USDA Economic Research Service had lowered net farm income in 2023 from $156 billion to $116 billion in 2024.<sup class="c20ref" data-footnote="tcm:84-323105-16" type="footnote"></sup> It's most likely that the USDA will lower that number further at the fall release. It might not fall as much as expected since the livestock feeders are still receiving strong prices, and the lower feed costs will help them gain profitability.  </p> <p>Feed purchases account for 48% of total intermediate expenses in the USDA farm and livestock P&amp;L estimates. What about the other 52% of the cost structure? Well, 32% of the intermediate input purchases fall into categories such as seed, fertilizer, crop chemical, and machinery. Without a doubt, these purchases, plus the super important category of cash rent for crop ground will be getting a serious pushback from the farm operators this fall as they try to avoid a repeat of this year’s losses. Landowners and crop input suppliers should be prepared for lots of questions along with price shopping from their customers.</p> <p>Ultimately, it is always best for everyone to grow a great crop. Higher supply creates more demand as prices drop and additional global consumers can be supplied. Economically, the process of adjustment is always uncertain and painful for the market participants who have the prices moving in the wrong direction for their consumption or profits. The key to managing market changes involves staying informed and making the right decision quickly, no matter how unpleasant. The old quote will remain correct no matter what, “It is not the well adapted that thrive but the highly adaptable.” The farm and agribusiness environment knows this better than almost anyone.</p>
