Clow launched the business in 2019. Just a few months later, the COVID pandemic hit. Healthcare workers emerged as a critical profession and demand for Marvel Medical’s services skyrocketed. </p> <p>“I learned 15 years of business in a matter of five,” Clow explained. “It taught me a lot as a leader.”</p> <h2>As industry normalizes, Marvel Medical recalibrates for future growth</h2> <p>At the peak of the pandemic in 2022, Marvel Medical generated $84 million in revenue. </p> <p>“We scaled and grew astronomically,” Clow acknowledged. “Our goal is to bring in $150-$200 million in revenue in the next three years.” </p> <p>In the short-term, the company is prepared for softer sales and revenue as the market normalizes after pandemic highs. Billing rates for clinical staffing, for example, rose by as much as 300 percent in some areas due to staffing shortages and heavy demand for services.  </p> <p>With prices dropping, greater competition, and conditions in the industry level-setting, Clow recognized the need to position her business for long-term success. That meant aligning with a new business partner, acquiring a complementary firm, and switching from a regional lender to a national financial institution. </p> <p>“We grew too fast during the pandemic and had to reset our business goals. It wasn’t a normal market,” she explained. “I learned we needed to establish the right governance, the right policies and controls, and find the right leaders to better drive our growth in the post-pandemic market.”</p> <p>In a short time, Marvel Medical achieved their goals. They’ve implemented the Entrepreneurial Operating System (EOS) to guide day-to-day operations, filled chief revenue officer (CRO) and chief operational officer (COO) roles, and welcomed different business partners. As a team, they’re focused on the future and how to differentiate their company in a crowded market, with a strong culture and hybrid work environment playing a critical role. Approximately one-third of the healthcare staffing firms in the U.S. are headquartered in Omaha, making workplace culture, amenities, and opportunities for learning and advancement of critical importance.</p> <h2>Wells Fargo brings financing and support that’s ‘instrumental’</h2> <p>Having the right bank by their side has been “support that’s instrumental,” according to Clow. Choosing Wells Fargo for commercial lending and treasury management services equips Marvel Medical with far more than just operating funds. </p> <p>“The entire Wells Fargo team has taken part in wanting our business to be successful; it isn’t just a transaction for them,” Clow said. “They’ve given us new ideas and capabilities; they’re helping us streamline our processes and put the correct controls in place, so I have a better visual of the business. I don’t think a lot of banks take the time to go that far.” </p> <p>She added, “With Wells Fargo, it was the first banking relationship where, as a female founder and owner, I felt that I truly had a voice and that I was taken seriously.” </p> <p>That level of attention, combined with open communication, has built exceptional trust and respect on both sides. </p> <p>Having access to Wells Fargo’s dedicated, experienced team that specializes in healthcare staffing arms Marvel Medical with another advantage. This group, headquartered in Omaha, focuses exclusively on providing asset-based working capital credit facilities to support staffing and service-based companies. Their attention, passion, and deep industry knowledge are particularly useful with the continued ups and downs in healthcare staffing. </p> <p>“Wells Fargo knows the healthcare staffing market better than any other bank we’ve had a relationship with,” Clow said. “They give us actionable analysis, data, and insight into the market—absolutely, they’re experts within our industry.”</p> <h2>Focus on diverse entrepreneurs builds confidence and connections</h2> <p>For Clow personally, an added benefit is Wells Fargo’s emphasis on supporting women and other historically underrepresented business owners. In particular, she appreciates the unique networking and educational opportunities created by Commercial Banking’s Diverse Segments team designed to help clients thrive. </p> <p>“We have the privilege of helping diverse-owned and -led business owners grow and reach their financial goals,” said Ruth Jacks, head of the Commercial Banking Diverse Segments team. “We do this in two ways. By collaborating with our Wells Fargo bankers to offer comprehensive financial solutions and through our partnerships and insights that support their business growth.”</p> <p>Through these engagements, Clow has developed relationships with numerous other women entrepreneurs and learned from national business experts. As a busy single mother as well as company founder and CEO, hearing from like-minded women executives with similar experiences has been significant. Opportunities that stand out for Clow include attending the Women’s Capital Summit in New York City, a Women Business Collaborative event sponsored by Wells Fargo, and participating in a special executive education session offered by Harvard Business School and sponsored by Wells Fargo in collaboration with Women Presidents Organization. </p> <p>“Having the ability to tap into this empowering network through this partnership really built up my confidence, knowing I’m not alone and that I can chase these dreams,” Clow said. </p> <p>She added, “Wells Fargo sees what women-owned businesses bring to the economy — as a female and a founder, it’s been a game-changer. They’re committed to giving me the tools I need to better operate and expand my business, with access to a network, community, and resources. It’s been phenomenal.” </p>
