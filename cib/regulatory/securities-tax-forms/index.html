					<p  >The IRS requires all U.S. payers and withholding agents, such as Wells Fargo Securities, to obtain certain IRS tax certification forms from all clients that receive a payment or earn income that could be reportable and subject to withholding. Without your proper tax forms, we are generally required to apply presumption rules and withhold taxes on reportable payments  at the highest rate set by law.</p> <p  >PLEASE NOTE:  If you are certifying your tax residency outside the U.S., the Forms W-8 listed below are what must be provided to a U.S. payer or withholding agent. You cannot provide a “self-certification form” that is permissible in other countries for similar due diligence requirements. </p> <p  >See the table below for the exact forms and supporting documentation we must receive from you. </p> <p  >For more information, contact your sales representative or banker.</p>

				<p>Instructions for the IRS Form W-8 and IRS Form W-9 can be complicated. The following information highlights our due diligence requirements and key aspects of these forms. The discussion is not intended to address every potential situation, and you should always consult with your tax advisor about how to complete the information. In addition to the form instructions, IRS Publication 515 is a very useful guide for foreign customers required to provide a Form W-8.</p> <p>Remember, we are required to withhold the maximum tax rate on payments if we do not have your proper tax forms. Effective on January 1, 2015, when the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (“FATCA”) took effect for US withholding agents, additional certifications are required to avoid 30% FATCA withholding on any U.S. sourced fixed, determinable, annual and periodic (“FDAP”) income.</p> <ul> <li> <strong>Non-U.S. entity clients</strong>  must provide one of the following types of IRS Form W-8: W-8BEN-E, W-8ECI, W-8EXP, or W-8IMY to certify their foreign tax residency and status. The current version of the form must be provided, and all of these forms were revised in 2014. Providing a valid Form W-8 prevents excess withholding on U.S. sourced fixed, determinable, annual and periodic (“FDAP”) income, such as dividends, interest, fees and other types of income. </li> <li> <strong>Non-U.S. individual clients</strong>  that are the beneficial owner of U.S. sourced FDAP income must provide a Form W-8BEN (Rev. February 2014). When acting in the capacity of a nominee, custodian or trustee, the correct form is IRS Form W-8IMY (generally along with other documentation, as explained below). <br /> </li> <li> <strong>U.S. entities and U.S. citizens or resident alien clients</strong>  must provide an IRS Form W-9 that (as of July 1, 2015) was revised by the IRS in December 2014. Entities that fail to provide a Form W-9 will be presumed to be a “Non-Participating Foreign Financial Institution” subject to 30% FATCA withholding. For individuals, the long-standing rule will apply that an individual who fails to provide a Form W-9 is an undocumented U.S. taxpayer subject to 28% backup withholding on payments or income reportable on a Form 1099. </li> </ul> <h2>Processing the forms</h2> <p>After we receive your tax form, we will review it for accuracy and completeness and conduct our due diligence. We may be required to obtain additional documentation based on the information provided on the original form. Then we can implement the correct treaty or other special rates and conditions.</p> <h2>Completing the forms</h2> <p>The following requirements apply if you are not a U.S. citizen. You must provide the information described below for us to process your forms.</p> <h3>Foreign individuals</h3> <table summary="Non-U.S. clients forms - Foreign individuals" class="c69Table" type="grid" style="width: 100%;"> <colgroup> <col style="width: 25%;" width="25%"> <col style="width: 25%;" width="25%"> <col style="width: 25%;" width="25%"></colgroup> <thead> <tr> <th id="thead1" rowspan="1">W-8BEN</th> <th id="thead2" rowspan="1">W-8ECI</th> <th id="thead3" rowspan="1">W-8EXP</th> <th id="thead4" rowspan="1">W-8IMY</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td rowspan="1" headers="thead1"> <ul> <li>Lines 1, 2, 3, and 8 must be completed.

An election made to the broker does not constitute a taxpayer election to the IRS. Customers must consult with their tax advisor about how to notify the IRS of an election. A customer who provides the broker with an election that does not correspond with the election made with the IRS will require the customer to make adjustments (e.g., on IRS Form 8949) when completing a tax return to reconcile the information. Brokers must report Form 1099 information based on the broker default or other customer election made to the broker in place as of year-end. </p> <p> <strong>Accrual periods:</strong>  Pursuant to Reg. §1.6045-1(n)(8), brokers must use the same accrual period that is used to report any OID or stated interest on a Form 1099. "In any other situation, a broker must use a semi-annual accrual period, or if a debt instrument provides for scheduled payments of principal or interest at regular intervals of less than six months over the entire term of the debt instrument, a broker must use an accrual period equal in length to this shorter interval." For transfer statements, however, the broker will need to provide the accrual amount that is applicable as of the date of transfer. This will require systems to calculate or receive from vendors accrual amounts on a daily basis. </p> <table summary="Debt instrument elections" class="c69Table" type="grid" style="width: 100%;"> <thead> <tr> <th id="thead1" rowspan="1">Election</th> <th id="thead2" rowspan="1">Broker default</th> <th id="thead3" rowspan="1">Customer election <sup class="c20ref" data-footnote="tcm:84-67085-16" type="footnote"></sup></th> <th id="thead4" rowspan="1">Taxpayer revocation <sup class="c20ref" data-footnote="tcm:84-67085-16" type="footnote"></sup></th> <th id="thead5" rowspan="1">Applicable level</th> <th id="thead6" rowspan="1">Code, regulation, etc.</th> <th id="thead7" rowspan="1">Reference</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td headers="thead1">Market discount – when recognized</td> <td headers="thead2"> <p>Deferred to date of sale, redemption, maturity, or other disposition.</p> <p>Therefore, the broker does not adjust the cost basis of the debt instrument on the Form 1099-B for the deferred amount of market discount.

				<h2  >Why do I need to submit an IRS Form W-8 or W-9 to Wells Fargo?</h2> <p  >The IRS requires us, as a U.S. payer or withholding agent, to obtain these tax forms for all of our clients. If we do not receive your proper forms, then we must withhold the maximum tax rate from reportable payments made to all accounts.</p> <h2  >What do you use IRS Form W-8 and W-9 for?</h2> <p  >We use these forms to identify your tax status and residency, plus identify our reporting and withholding requirements. For foreign clients, W-8 forms establish their foreign tax residency and treaty rate, if applicable. For U.S. entity and U.S. citizen and resident alien clients, the W-9 form certifies their tax residency status, and that the taxpayer ID number provided is correct and matches to the name provided on the first line of the Form W-9. The form may also be used to inform us as to whether or not an entity is subject to backup withholding or FATCA reporting if the account is maintained outside the U.S.</p> <p  >Please be aware that a U.S. citizen or resident alien remains a U.S. taxpayer, regardless of how long they have ceased to reside in the U.S., until that person has filed all the necessary documentation with the IRS, Department of State, or Office of Homeland Security, as applicable.</p> <h2  >Can I fax or send you a copy of an IRS Form W-8 or W-9?</h2> <p  >For all W-8 forms, you must send us the originals. We cannot process faxed or copied W-8 forms. You may fax W-9 forms to Wells Fargo.</p> <h2  >Does one IRS form cover multiple accounts?</h2> <p  >Yes. If you have multiple accounts under the same legal name, you may submit one W-8 or W-9 for all of those accounts, provided the ownership is the same for each account. You should inform us if you have multiple accounts for which you want to use the same tax certification form.  However, keep in mind that foreign entities sometimes need to provide different types of the Form W-8 depending on the reason the account is opened (for example, for the benefit of the entity or for the benefit of its customers) and the type of income it is receiving.</p> <h2  >Why are you requesting additional documentation after I have submitted an IRS Form W-8?</h2> <p  >As part of our due diligence requirements, we must verify the Form W-8 is complete and has no conflicting information. For example, if an individual non-resident alien (NRA) customer shows a U.S. mailing address on a Form W-8BEN, that makes that form defective and creates the presumption the person is a resident alien. Therefore, if we have requested additional documentation and a letter of explanation from you, we are trying to cure a defect and need that additional documentation to confirm your tax residency status or correctly apply treaty benefits. Individuals normally need to provide a copy of their current passport or driver’s license along with a letter explaining why they are using a U.S. address or why their permanent tax residency country is different from the country listed in a treaty claim.  For entities, the additional documentation required is normally a copy of that entity’s articles of incorporation or other organizational documentation citing it is organized outside the U.S.</p> <h2  >Does the IRS Form W-8 or W-9 expire?</h2> <p  >Generally, the W-8 form is valid for the year it is signed, plus three additional calendar years unless the information on the form changes during the three-year period. The W-9 form that is valid when we receive it is valid indefinitely, unless there is a name change or tax residency change.</p> <h2  >What is your due diligence process for obtaining an expiring IRS Form W-8?</h2> <p  >Before the end of the third calendar year in which the W-8 form expires, we will send non-U.S. clients a solicitation letter requesting that you complete and return to us a new W-8 form before the end of the third calendar year. This will ensure we do not withhold at the highest rate from your payments when you would be eligible for a lower rate or exemption from withholding because the previous certifications on your Form W-8 expired as of the beginning of the new calendar year.</p>
