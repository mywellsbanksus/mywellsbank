<p>Offer valid 10/01/2022 - 06/30/2023. Your initial rate will be a 0% fixed interest rate for the first 9 months after account opening as long as a default does not occur under the terms of your Customer Agreement. Introductory rates will not apply to balances remaining after the end of the introductory period or to cash advances, which include online and telephone transfers and SUPERCHECKS<sup>TM</sup> transactions, incurred at any time. You will be assigned a variable interest rate between Wells Fargo Prime + 7.99% and Wells Fargo Prime + 17.99%, depending on your personal and business credit evaluation. Rates are subject to change and may be higher or lower than the stated ranges. The interest rate that you are assigned applies to purchases after the expiration of the introductory period, unless a default occurs under the Customer Agreement and we elect to increase the rate, or we exercise our right to change the terms of the account. The interest rate for balance transfers and cash advances, incurred at any time will be Prime + 20.74%, unless a default occurs under the Customer Agreement and we elect to increase the rate, or we exercise our right to change the terms of the account.

Bank's announced Prime Rate is subject to change at any time. If a default occurs under the Customer Agreement, the interest rate applied to all balances may be increased by the Bank to a rate equal to Prime + 24.74%, subject to a maximum rate of 29.99%. There is a 4% ($10 minimum; $175 maximum) fee for balance transfers and cash advances, which include online and telephone transfers and SUPERCHECKS<sup>TM</sup> transactions. Generally, we will apply your Minimum Payment first to balances with lower interest rates (such as Purchases) before balances with higher interest rates (such as Cash Advances). Payments made in excess of the Minimum Payment will be applied to balances with higher interest rates first before balances with lower ones. Therefore, the benefit of an introductory offer will be reduced if the account has existing balances or additional transactions that are subject to standard interest rates. Carrying any balance, including an introductory balance, from month to month will eliminate an interest-free grace period for purchases during that month.</p>
