(&#34;Bank&#34;, &#34;we&#34;, &#34;us&#34;) is establishing for use by you (if a sole proprietor) or your business organization (such a sole proprietor or business organization are referred to in this Customer Agreement as &#34;Customer&#34;, &#34;you&#34;, and &#34;your&#34;) and your designated representatives. The account is established under the terms and conditions of the SBA Express program of the United States Small Business Administration (&#34;SBA&#34;). Your written agreement to be bound by the terms of the Customer Agreement, as amended from time to time, or the use of the Account including but not limited to using SUPERCHECKS™ drafts, a Wells Fargo Small Business Advantage Mastercard<sup>®</sup> card (&#34;SBA Business Card&#34;), or a request for a transfer from the Account by anyone authorized by you, shall be evidence of your acceptance of the terms and conditions of this Agreement including but not limited to applicable Finance Charges and Other Charges. You agree to be bound by and comply with each and every following term and condition of this agreement.<br /><br /><a href="#BacktotheTop">Back to the Top</a></p></span></li><li><h3 style="font-weight:bold;font-size:14pt;color:black"><a name="CustomerRoles"></a>Customer Roles</h3><span style="font-weight:normal;font-size:10pt;color:black"><h4 style="font-weight:bold;font-size:12pt;color:black">Account Guarantor</h4><p></p><p>An Account Guarantor is an individual who signed as an authorized representative of the business and as a personal Account Guarantor of the business’s debt to the Bank, who has full access to Account funds and the ability to obtain information about the Account from customer service and online banking. An Account Guarantor is personally liable for the entire debt incurred on the Account.</p><h4 style="font-weight:bold;font-size:12pt;color:black">Authorized Signer</h4><p></p><p>An Authorized Signer is any person other than an Account Guarantor who has been authorized by Customer to access the Account and is issued an SBA Business Card. An Authorized Signer has full access to the Account funds and the ability to obtain information about the Account from customer service.</p><h4 style="font-weight:bold;font-size:12pt;color:black"><p>Company Contact</p></h4><p></p><p>A Company Contact is any person other than an Account Guarantor who has been authorized by Customer to access the Account, but is not issued an SBA Business Card. However, a Company Contact has full access to the Account funds and the ability to obtain information about the Account from customer service. Company Contacts may also request other Authorized Signers or Company Contacts to be designated.</p><h4 style="font-weight:bold;font-size:12pt;color:black">Additional SBA Business Cards</h4><p></p><p>You may request that up to 3 additional SBA Business Cards be issued to either an Account Guarantor or Authorized Signer. Additional SBA Business Cards are embossed with a common Account number and business name, but the personal name will be unique. Any person issued an additional SBA Business Card is granted full access to, and authority to use, the Account. A person issued an additional SBA Business Card may be able to view the Account in Wells Fargo Online® Banking and also view any other Bank product(s) linked to the Account if that person is also an owner or signor on the other product(s). A person with an additional SBA Business Card would be able to initiate transfers from the Account and payments to the Account from other linked Bank products.</p><h4 style="font-weight:bold;font-size:12pt;color:black"><p>To add, change, or revoke Authorized Signer/Company Contact privileges</p></h4><p></p><p>If you wish to alter Authorized Signer/Company Contact privileges, you must contact Small Business Customer Service at <strong>1-800-225-5935</strong>. Requests to add, change or revoke Authorized Signer/Company Contact privileges may be made over the phone, or in writing via standard form for such requests. </p><h4 style="font-weight:bold;font-size:12pt;color:black">To add, change, or revoke additional SBA Business Cards</h4><p></p><p>All requests to add, change or revoke additional SBA Business Cards must be made by phone or in writing. You may obtain a standard form for completing such requests from Small Business Customer Service at <strong>1-800-225-5935</strong>.</p><h4 style="font-weight:bold;font-size:12pt;color:black">Ending/revoking SBA Business Card privileges</h4><p>If you wish to cancel an additional SBA Business Card or revoke the access granted to an Authorized Signer, in addition to making a phone or written request, you must recover the additional SBA Business Card and return it to Bank at the address listed in the Inquiry &amp; Correspondence section at the end of this Agreement. If the additional SBA Business Card is not recovered and returned to Bank, you will continue to be liable for all activity even after notifying Bank. If you are unable to recover an additional SBA Business Card, you must request that Bank change the Account number and reissue SBA Business Cards only to those persons who remain authorized by you.</p><p><a href="#BacktotheTop">Back to the Top</a></p></span></li><li><h3 style="font-weight:bold;font-size:14pt;color:black"><a name="PermissibleUse"></a>Permissible Use</h3><span style="font-weight:normal;font-size:10pt;color:black"><h4 style="font-weight:bold;font-size:12pt;color:black">Permissible use</h4><p>The Account will be used for business purposes only. In no event shall the Account be used for any transaction that is illegal under any applicable law. You represent that you (if a sole proprietor) and your business organization are not a Money Service Business as defined by federal law, or have identified yourself to Bank as such a business and have complied with all applicable laws, rules and regulations governing such businesses. You may not use your Account to pay any other credit account at Wells Fargo. Funds from your account may not be used to purchase, carry or trade securities or to repay debt incurred to purchase, carry or trade securities. Completing or attempting such a transaction may lead to your Account being closed.</p><h4 style="font-weight:bold;font-size:12pt;color:black">Authorizations</h4><p></p><p>All transactions on an Account are subject to prior approval by Bank (&#34;Authorizations&#34;). Bank reserves the right to block authorizations from certain types of merchants. These include but are not limited to merchants whose business is selling crypto currencies and online gambling. Bank reserves the right to limit the number of Authorizations given during any period of time (day, weekend, week, etc.) and Bank may deny an Authorization if Bank suspects that the Account is being used without your permission. If Bank’s Authorization system is not working, Bank may be unable to give an Authorization even though the transaction would not exceed the Credit Limit and your Account is in good standing. For security reasons, Bank cannot explain the details of how the authorization system works. Bank shall not be liable for failing to give any such Authorization. Bank may, but is not required to, authorize transactions that will cause the balance on an Account to exceed the Credit Limit assigned to an Account, and you agree that you are liable for any such transactions as well as the associated Finance Charges and Other Charges. If you give your credit card information to a merchant to bill your Account for recurring payments, or to keep it on file for future purchases or payments, and your card number, expiration date, or security code changes, you are responsible for notifying the merchant of your new card information. Some card networks provide update services and receive updated card information from Wells Fargo. Merchants that participate in such services will receive updated information from the network for credit card accounts that you have provided to the merchant for recurring or future purchases or payments. We cannot tell you which merchant will receive updated card information when your card information changes. You should always provide your new card information to each merchant with whom you do business because some merchants do not subscribe to such network services.</p><p><a href="#BacktotheTop">Back to the Top</a></p></span></li><li><h3 style="font-weight:bold;font-size:14pt;color:black"><a name="AccountFeatures"></a>Account Features</h3><span style="font-weight:normal;font-size:10pt;color:black"><h4 style="font-weight:bold;font-size:12pt;color:black">Credit limit</h4><p>The Credit Limit of an Account is shown in separate correspondence provided to you at the time an Account is opened, and on each of the monthly periodic billing statements. You may not use or permit the use of the Account in any way that will cause the Account to exceed its Credit Limit. You are responsible for repaying outstanding advances under the Account, including but not limited to those that exceed its Credit Limit.

The following services are available, up to the amount of the Credit Limit of the Account.</p><h4 style="font-weight:bold;font-size:12pt;color:black">Purchases with an SBA Business card</h4><p>An SBA Business Card may be used to purchase goods or services wherever a credit card bearing the Mastercard logo is accepted.</p><h4 style="font-weight:bold;font-size:12pt;color:black">Foreign transactions</h4><p>If you originate a transaction in a foreign currency the amount will be converted to U.S. dollars before posting to your Account. Mastercard International will convert the transaction into a U.S. dollar amount by using its currency conversion procedure in effect at the time the transaction is processed. Currently, their regulations and procedures provide that the currency conversion rate is either; (1) a wholesale rate, determined by the processor of the transaction, which rate may vary from the rate Mastercard International itself receives; or (2) a government-mandated rate for the applicable currency as determined under applicable Mastercard International regulations and procedures. This rate may differ from the rate in effect when the transaction occurred or when it was posted to your Account. Your periodic statement will display additional details with most foreign currency transactions including: name of the foreign currency, units of the foreign currency, and the exchange rate. Bank does not charge an additional fee for foreign transactions.</p><h4 style="font-weight:bold;font-size:12pt;color:black">Third Party/Mobile Devices and Digital Wallets</h4><p></p><p>We may also permit any Cardholder to load information about your Account onto third party/mobile devices (such as a smartphone, tablet, or any other handheld or wearable communication device that allows a Cardholder to store or electronically present Account information) that would enable the Cardholder to make Purchases or engage in credit transactions for an Account without needing to show an SBA Business Card. You and we agree that any such use of an Account will be subject to all the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement.</p><p>To the extent a Cardholder does use a third party/mobile device to make a credit transaction on an Account, or load information about an Account onto any such device, you need to be aware that we do not control the device and cannot guarantee the performance of either the device or any third party.</p><p>Additionally, you agree that:</p><ul><li>You will direct each Cardholder on your Account to carefully protect the security of any devices the same as you would your cash, checks, credit cards, and other valuable information. We encourage you to password protect or lock any such device to help prevent an unauthorized person from using it.

Third parties, such as merchants, card association networks, mobile carriers, mobile wallet operators, and software application providers may use and receive information in connection with a credit transaction. Third parties may also receive information about your mobile device when you use it to make a credit transaction.</li><li>We may, at any time, partially or fully restrict a Cardholder’s ability to make credit transactions through a third party/mobile device.

You may obtain a Cash Advance and perform balance inquiries using your SBA Business Card with a Personal Identification Number (&#34;PIN&#34;) at all Wells Fargo® ATMs, or any ATM which displays any of the logos appearing on the back of your SBA Business Card.</p><h4 style="font-weight:bold;font-size:12pt;color:black"><em>SUPERCHECKS</em>™ advances</h4><p><em>SUPERCHECKS</em> drafts may be used to access an Account. The drafts may be used like normal bank checks and will post to your Account as Cash Advances. When the Bank receives a draft, the Bank will pay it by advancing the amount of the draft from the Account unless the Account is delinquent, in default, closed or the draft would cause the balance to exceed the Credit Limit of the Account. You may not write <em>SUPERCHECKS</em> drafts as payment for your Account. All <em>SUPERCHECKS</em> drafts must be written in U.S. dollars. No fees are assessed when ordering <em>SUPERCHECKS</em> drafts. If you have a dispute with a merchant regarding property or services that you are unable to resolve with the merchant, and you used a <em>SUPERCHECKS</em> draft as payment, you will not have the right to assert against us any claims or defenses involving that transaction. <em>SUPERCHECKS</em> drafts may only be used and processed as paper drafts. Bank will not honor ACH or other electronic transactions in which you have given/used the routing transit number and/or account number printed on the <em>SUPERCHECKS</em> drafts. In addition to Bank rejecting any such electronic transaction, the intended payee of the draft may assess fees or penalties.</p><h4 style="font-weight:bold;font-size:12pt;color:black"><em>SUPERCHECKS</em> stop payment</h4><p>Bank does not guarantee the stop payment of a <em>SUPERCHECKS</em> draft; however, we will make an attempt to stop payment of the draft within a reasonable period of time after we receive your stop payment order, provided all information given to us is accurate and complete, and the draft has not already been paid. The stop payment request will remain on our system for six (6) months, unless the stop payment order is revoked or the draft is stopped. After six (6) months, you must contact us if you wish to re-enter the stop payment request.</p><h4 style="font-weight:bold;font-size:12pt;color:black">Overdraft protection advances</h4><p>Bank will make advances from your Account (&#34;Overdraft Protection Advances&#34;) to help you avoid the inconvenience and expense of overdrafts and returned items in a Wells Fargo® Business Checking Account (&#34;Checking Account&#34;). The types of accounts that can be linked for overdraft protection depend on the Checking Account you have. Some Checking Account plans also allow you to link your Checking Account both to a credit Account and a deposit account at the same time. If this is the case, the following will apply to Overdraft Protection Advances from your credit Account:<br /><br />• If you choose to link both a deposit account and a credit Account to provide overdraft protection, you may designate the account from which you want the funds advanced first.<br /><br />• If you do not designate an account order for Overdraft Protection Advances, Bank will advance funds from your linked deposit account first, and then from your linked credit Account, subject to credit availability under this Agreement.<br /><br />Bank will transfer the exact dollar amount to cover the overdraft, subject to your Credit Limit and a minimum overdraft advance amount of $25. If the amount of available credit on your Account is less than $25, or less than the overdraft, Bank will transfer the amount of the available credit. Overdraft Protection Advances, as well as finance charges, may cause the balance on your Account to exceed the Credit Limit. If there is more than one person authorized to access, or listed on, the Checking Account, you will be responsible for all Overdraft Protection Advances from the credit Account regardless of which individual accessed the Checking Account funds.<br /><br />Overdraft Protection Advances are an optional feature that may not be available. Bank reserves the right to terminate Overdraft Protection Advances without notice if Overdraft Protection Advances are the result of payments to the Account, or if a zero or negative balance is maintained in the linked Checking Account. Periodic Finance Charges apply to all Overdraft Protection Advance balances from the date of the Overdraft Protection Advance.</p><h4 style="font-weight:bold;font-size:12pt;color:black">Transfers</h4><p></p><p>You authorize Bank to make transfers up to your available Credit Limit between the Account and other accounts upon Bank's receipt of instructions from you, an Account Guarantor of your Account, an Authorized Signer, a Company Contact, or any other person you authorize orally, electronically, or in writing to request such a transfer. Bank will have no liability for any transfer believed by Bank in good faith to have been authorized by you to submit the request. You will indemnify and hold Bank harmless from and against any damages, liabilities, costs, or expenses (including attorney's fees) arising out of any claim by you or any third party against Bank in connection with Bank's performance of transfers as described above. Transfers will be treated as Cash Advances unless otherwise specified and will not be eligible to earn Rewards points.</p><p><a href="#BacktotheTop">Back to the Top</a></p></span></li><li><h3

However, if the New Balance shown on your previous statement is less than $100, the Late Charge will be $25 and, if an Account has been delinquent two times or more in the past 12 billing cycles, Bank may assess a Late Charge of $50. Bank may, but is not required to, contact you to inform you of other Late Charge amounts in cases of default.</p><h4 style="font-weight:bold;font-size:12pt;color:black"><p><strong>B.  Returned SUPERCHECKS</strong></p></h4><p>If Bank receives a SUPERCHECKS draft for payment to a third party, and the Account has insufficient funds to cover the amount of the draft, or if the Account is otherwise not in good standing, the draft may be returned unpaid.</p><h4 style="font-weight:bold;font-size:12pt;color:black"><p><strong>C.  Stop Payment fee</strong></p></h4><p>If you request that Bank place a &#34;Stop Payment&#34; on a <em>SUPERCHECKS</em> draft, Bank may assess a charge of $29 for each Stop Payment request.</p><h4 style="font-weight:bold;font-size:12pt;color:black"><p><strong>D.  Fee waivers</strong></p></h4><p>Bank may waive any of the fees in this Agreement at Bank’s discretion; however, Bank reserves the right to begin charging any fee that was previously waived without providing prior notice to you.<br /><br /><a href="#BacktotheTop">Back to the Top</a></p></span></li><li><h3 style="font-weight:bold;font-size:14pt;color:black"><a name="FinanceCharges"></a>Finance Charges</h3><span style="font-weight:normal;font-size:10pt;color:black"><h4 style="font-weight:bold;font-size:12pt;color:black">Finance Charge</h4><p>The total Finance Charge for an Account is the sum of the Periodic Finance Charge plus the Transaction Finance Charge assessed on the Account. The methods used to determine the balance or balances upon which the Finance Charges are computed are as follows:</p><ol style="list-style-type:upper-alpha"><li><h5 style="font-weight:bold;font-size:10pt;color:black"><div style="text-align:left">Periodic finance charge</div></h5><p>For each type of balance on an Account (i.e., the Cash Advance balance, the Purchases balance, or Other balance) the Periodic Finance Charge is calculated by multiplying the Average Daily Balance during the billing cycle by the number of days in the billing cycle and then multiplying this product by the applicable Daily Finance Charge Rate.<br /><br />Periodic Finance Charge = (Average Daily Balance) x (#days) x (Daily Finance Charge Rate).</p></li><li><h5 style="font-weight:bold;font-size:10pt;color:black"><div style="text-align:left">Calculation of Average Daily Balance (&#34;ADB&#34;)</div></h5><p>To calculate your ADB each month, we calculate the daily balance of the Account for each day in the billing period (&#34;Daily Balance&#34;), add the Daily Balances together, and divide that total amount by the number of days in the billing period. Average Daily Balances for Cash Advances, Purchases, and Other categories are calculated separately and may be subject to different rates. For each category of balance (Cash Advances, Purchases, and Other), we calculate the Daily Balance by starting with the beginning balance related to that category plus any new activity (Cash Advances, Purchases, and Other) posted as of that day, plus any related unpaid Finance Charges, Fees, or Other Charges, and add a Periodic Finance Charge equal to the previous day's balance multiplied by the applicable Daily Finance Charge Rate. We then subtract the amount of any payments or credits applied to that balance category.</p></li><li><h5 style="font-weight:bold;font-size:10pt;color:black">When periodic finance charge begins and ends</h5><p>The Periodic Finance Charge for Purchases and Advances begins on the date the transaction is made. The Periodic Finance Charge for <em>SUPERCHECKS</em> transactions may begin the earlier of: the transaction date, the date a <em>SUPERCHECKS</em> draft is deposited by the payee, or the date we receive the <em>SUPERCHECKS</em> draft for posting to your Account.</p></li><li><h5 style="font-weight:bold;font-size:10pt;color:black"><div style="text-align:left">Daily finance charge rate</div></h5><p>The Daily Finance Charge Rate will either be a fixed rate or a variable rate subject to a Lifetime Rate Floor (see below). Please refer to separate correspondence from the Bank provided at the time your Account is opened or at a later date to determine your Daily Finance Charge Rate. The Daily Finance Charge Rate for Cash Advances, Purchases, and Other balances may differ. The Daily Finance Charge Rate is calculated by dividing the applicable interest rate by 365.<br /><br />If your Account is subject to a variable rate, that rate will be determined for each monthly billing cycle by taking the Wells Fargo Prime Rate (see below) in effect one business day prior to your Statement Closing Date and adding an additional amount (&#34;Spread&#34;). Any changes in your Daily Finance Charge Rate will apply both to current and future balances on the Account and the Daily Finance Charge Rate will continue to vary even if the Account is closed.<br /><br />The Bank initially determines your Spread at the time the Account is opened and may subsequently change the Spread at Bank’s sole discretion. Please refer to separate correspondence from the Bank regarding your Spread.</p></li><li><h5 style="font-weight:bold;font-size:10pt;color:black">Lifetime Rate Floor</h5><p>The Daily Finance Charge Rate for any balance will never fall below 0.0%.

You may end your Draw Period at any time up to and including a date that is five years (60 months) from the line of credit’s original open date.  If you end your Draw Period before five years (60 months), your Current Payment Due will be equal to the sum of 1% of your New Balance plus Finance Charges, Fees, and Other Charges; rounded to the next highest dollar, with up to a $200 minimum.  However, if the New Balance is less than $200, the entire New Balance is the Current Payment Due.  </p><h4 style="font-weight:bold;font-size:12pt;color:black"><p>Repayment Period and Current Payment Due</p></h4><p></p><p>When your Draw Period comes to an end five years (60 months) from the line of credit’s original open date, if you have an outstanding balance, your account will enter a repayment period of five years (60 months) (the &#34;Repayment Period&#34;).  During the Repayment Period, your Current Payment Due will be based on principal payable monthly in equal successive installments over the Repayment Period (plus any applicable Finance Charges, Fees, and Other Charges).</p><h4 style="font-weight:bold;font-size:12pt;color:black">Total amount due</h4><p>The Total Amount Due shown on the statement is equal to the sum of the Current Payment Due PLUS any Past Due Amount, PLUS any payment due on promotional balances required by the terms of a promotion.

Arbitration may be demanded before the institution of a judicial proceeding, or during a judicial proceeding, but not more than 60 days after service of a complaint, third party complaint, cross-claim, or any answer thereto, or any amendment to any of such pleadings. A &#34;Dispute&#34; shall include any dispute, claim, or controversy of any kind, in contract or in tort, legal or equitable, now existing or hereafter arising, relating in any way to any aspect of this agreement, or any other agreement, document or instrument to which this Arbitration Program is attached or in which it appears or is referenced, or any related agreements, documents or instruments or any renewal, extension, modification, or refinancing of any indebtedness or obligation relating to the foregoing, including without limitation, their negotiation, execution, collateralization, administration, repayment, modification, extension, substitution, formation, inducement, enforcement, default, or termination. This provision is a material inducement for the parties entering into the transactions relating to this Agreement, DISPUTES SUBMITTED TO ARBITRATION ARE NOT RESOLVED IN COURT BY A JUDGE OR JURY. TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY AND VOLUNTARILY WAIVE ANY RIGHT THEY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY DISPUTE ARBITRATED PURSUANT TO THIS ARBITRATION PROGRAM.</p></li><li><h5 style="font-weight:bold;font-size:10pt;color:black">Governing rules</h5><p>Any arbitration proceeding will: (i) be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (Title 9 of the United States Code), notwithstanding any conflicting choice of law provision in any of the documents between the parties; and (ii) be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (&#34;AAA&#34;), or such other administrator as the parties shall mutually agree upon, in accordance with the AAA’s commercial dispute resolution procedures, unless the claim or counterclaim is at least $1,000,000.00 exclusive of claimed interest, arbitration fees, and costs in which case the arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the AAA’s optional procedures for large, complex commercial disputes (the commercial dispute resolution procedures or the optional procedures for large complex commercial disputes to be referred to herein, as applicable, as the &#34;Rules&#34;). If there is any inconsistency between the terms hereof and the Rules, the terms and procedures set forth herein shall control. Arbitration proceedings hereunder shall be conducted at a location mutually agreeable to the parties, or if they cannot agree, then at a location selected by the AAA in the state of South Dakota. Any party who fails or refuses to submit to arbitration following a demand by any other party shall bear all costs and expenses incurred by such other party in compelling arbitration of any Dispute. The arbitrator shall award all costs and expenses of the arbitration proceeding. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to be a waiver by any party that is a lender of the protections afforded to it under 12 U.S.C. §91 or any similar applicable state law.</p></li><li><h5 style="font-weight:bold;font-size:10pt;color:black">No waiver of provisional remedies, self-help, and foreclosure</h5><p>The arbitration requirement does not limit the right of any party to: (i) foreclose against any real or personal property collateral; (ii) exercising self-help remedies relating to collateral or proceeds of collateral such as setoff or repossession; or (iii) obtain provisional or ancillary remedies such as replevin, injunctive relief, attachment, or the appointment of a receiver, before during or after the pendency of any arbitration proceeding. This exclusion does not constitute a waiver of the right or obligation of any party to submit any Dispute to arbitration or reference hereunder, including those arising from the exercise of the actions detailed in section (i), (ii), and (iii) of this paragraph.</p></li><li><h5 style="font-weight:bold;font-size:10pt;color:black">Arbitrator qualifications and powers</h5><p>Any arbitration proceeding in which the amount in controversy is $5,000,000.00 or less will be decided by a single arbitrator selected according to the Rules, and who shall not render an award of greater than $5,000,000.00. Any Dispute in which the amount in controversy exceeds $5,000,000.00 shall be decided by majority vote of a panel of three arbitrators; provided however, that all three arbitrators must actively participate in all hearings and deliberations. Every arbitrator must be a neutral practicing attorney or a retired member of the state or federal judiciary, in either case with a minimum of ten years’ experience in the substantive law applicable to the subject matter of the Dispute. The arbitrator will determine whether or not an issue is arbitratable and will give effect to the statutes of limitation in determining any claim. In any arbitration proceeding the arbitrator will decide (by documents only or with a hearing at the arbitrator’s discretion) any pre-hearing motions which are similar to motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim or motions for summary adjudication. The arbitrator shall resolve all Disputes in accordance with the applicable substantive law and may grant any remedy or relief that a court of such state could order or grant within the scope hereof and such ancillary relief as is necessary to make effective any award. The arbitrator shall also have the power to award recovery of all costs and fees, to impose sanctions and to take such other action as the arbitrator deems necessary to the same extent a judge could pursuant to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the applicable state rules of civil procedure, or other applicable law. Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. The institution and maintenance of an action for judicial relief or pursuit of a provisional or ancillary remedy shall not constitute a waiver of the right of any party, including the plaintiff, to submit the controversy or claim to arbitration if any other party contests such action for judicial relief.</p></li><li><h5 style="font-weight:bold;font-size:10pt;color:black">Discovery</h5><p>In any arbitration proceeding discovery will be permitted in accordance with the Rules. All discovery shall be expressly limited to matters directly relevant to the Dispute being arbitrated and must be completed no later than 20 days before the hearing date. Any requests for an extension of the discovery periods, or any discovery disputes, will be subject to final determination by the arbitrator upon a showing that the request for discovery is essential for the party’s presentation and that no alternative means for obtaining information is available.</p></li><li><h5 style="font-weight:bold;font-size:10pt;color:black">Class proceedings and consolidations</h5><p>No party shall be entitled to join or consolidate disputes by or against others in any arbitration, except parties to this Agreement, or to include in any arbitration any dispute as a representative or member of a class, or to act in any arbitration in the interest of the general public or in a private attorney general capacity.</p></li><li><h5 style="font-weight:bold;font-size:10pt;color:black">Miscellaneous</h5><p></p><p>To the maximum extent practicable, the AAA, the arbitrators, and the parties shall take all action required to conclude any arbitration proceeding within 180 days of the filing of the Dispute with the AAA. No arbitrator or other party to an arbitration proceeding may disclose the existence, content or results thereof, except for disclosures of information by a party required in the ordinary course of its business or by applicable law or regulation. If more than one agreement for arbitration by or between the parties potentially applies to a Dispute, the arbitration provision most directly related to the documents between the parties or the subject matter of the Dispute shall control. This arbitration provision shall survive the repayment of the obligations that are the subject of this agreement and the termination, amendment, or expiration of any of the documents or any relationship between the parties.</p><p><a href="#BacktotheTop">Back to the Top</a></p><p>© 2024 Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.
