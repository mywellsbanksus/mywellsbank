Knowledge-Based Authentication (questions only an individual should know about themselves such as what street they lived on in 2009) used by organizations across industries limits the risk of identity theft or account takeover. Alerts are sent when a series of knowledge-based authentication questions are generated to validate the Cardholder's identity (i.e. when accessing a credit report).

In order to use this service, Cardholders must provide some personal information, such as name, address, date of birth, and SSN, and undergo either digital verification via text or knowledge-based authentication. ID Theft Protection sends alert notification emails, such as change of address alerts, anytime potentially unauthorized inquiries or suspicious activities on Cardholder's credit file are detected so they can take immediate action to minimize damage.</li></ul></li><li style="list-style-type:none;margin-top:3"><h6 style="font-weight:bold;color:black;margin-top:3"><strong>Additional Information</strong></h6><ul style="padding-left:0pt"><li style="list-style-type:none"><strong>Small Business ID Theft Protection</strong> upgrades ID Theft Protection identity monitoring services by adding URL and Domain monitoring to the existing list of monitored items.

This makes it more difficult for an identity thief to open new accounts in their name.

Benefits are provided to you, the <strong>Account Holder</strong>, at no additional charge. Non-insurance services may have associated costs, which will be your responsibility (for example, legal referrals are free, but the lawyer’s fee is your responsibility).The insurance benefits are provided under a group policy issued by New Hampshire Insurance Company, an AIG company. This MasterRental Guide to Benefits is a summary of benefits provided to you. The above Key Terms (as supplemented or modified by the Additional Key Terms) and <strong>EOC </strong>are governed by the Group Policy.</p><p style="margin-left:5pt"><strong>Effective date of benefits:</strong> Effective October 27, 2020, this MasterRental Guide to Benefits replaces all prior disclosures, program descriptions, advertising, and brochures by any party. The Policyholder and the insurer reserve the right to change the benefits and features of these programs at any time. Notice will be provided for any changes. </p><p style="margin-left:5pt"><strong>Cancellation:</strong> The Policyholder can cancel these benefits at any time or choose not to renew the insurance coverage for all <strong>Cardholders.</strong> If the Policyholder does cancel these benefits, you will be notified in advance. If the insurance company terminates, cancels, or chooses not to renew the coverage to the Policyholder, you will be notified as soon as is practicable. Insurance benefits will still apply for any benefits you were eligible for prior to the date of such terminations, cancellation, or non-renewal, subject to the terms and conditions of coverage. </p><p style="margin-left:5pt"><strong>Benefits to you:</strong> These benefits apply only to the <strong>Cardholder </strong>whose cards are issued by U.S. financial institutions. The United States for purposes of this section is defined as the fifty (50) United States, the District of Columbia, American Samoa, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. No person or entity other than the <strong>Cardholder </strong>shall have any legal or equitable right, remedy, or claim for benefits, insurance proceeds and <strong>Damages </strong>under or arising out of these programs. These benefits do not apply if your card privileges have been cancelled. However, insurance benefits will still apply for any benefit you were eligible for prior to the date that your account is suspended or cancelled, subject to the terms and conditions of coverage. </p><p style="margin-left:5pt"><strong>Transfer of rights or benefits:</strong> No rights or benefits provided under these insurance benefits may be assigned without the prior written consent of the claim <strong>Administrator </strong>for these benefits. </p><p style="margin-left:5pt"><strong>Misrepresentation and Fraud:</strong> Benefits shall be void if the <strong>Cardholder </strong>has concealed or misrepresented any material facts concerning this coverage. </p><p style="margin-left:5pt"><strong>Dispute Resolution – Arbitration:</strong> This <strong>EOC </strong>requires binding arbitration if there is an unresolved dispute concerning this <strong>EOC </strong>(including the cost of, lack of, or actual repair or replacement arising from a loss or breakdown). Under this Arbitration provision, You give up your right to resolve any dispute arising from this <strong>EOC </strong>by a judge and/or a jury. You also agree not to participate as a class representative or class member in any class action litigation, any class arbitration or any consolidation of individual arbitrations. In arbitration, a group of three (3) arbitrators (each of whom is an independent, neutral third party) will give a decision after hearing the parties’ positions. The decision of a majority of the arbitrators will determine the outcome of the arbitration and the decision of the arbitrators shall be final and binding and cannot be reviewed or changed by, or appealed to, a court of law. To start arbitration, the disputing party must make a written demand to the other party for arbitration. This demand must be made within one (1) year of the earlier of the date the loss occurred or the dispute arose. The parties will each separately select an arbitrator. The two (2) arbitrators will select a third arbitrator called an &#34;umpire.&#34; Each party will each pay the expense of the arbitrator selected by that party. The expense of the umpire will be shared equally by the parties. Unless otherwise agreed to by the parties, the arbitration will take place in the county and state in which you live. The arbitration shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C.A. § 1 et. seq.) and not by any state law concerning arbitration. The rules of the American Arbitration Association <strong>(www.adr.org)</strong> will apply to any arbitration under this <strong>EOC</strong>. The laws of the state of New York (without giving effect to its conflict of law principles) govern all matters arising out of or relating to this <strong>EOC </strong>and all transactions contemplated by this <strong>EOC</strong>, including, without limitation, the validity, interpretation, construction, performance and enforcement of this <strong>EOC</strong>. </p><p style="margin-left:5pt"><strong>Due Diligence: </strong>All parties are expected to exercise due diligence to avoid or diminish any theft, loss or <strong>Damage </strong>to the property insured under these programs. &#34;Due diligence&#34; means the performance of all vigilant activity, attentiveness, and care that would be taken by a reasonable and prudent person in the same or similar circumstances in order to guard and protect the item. </p><p style="margin-left:5pt"><strong>Subrogation:</strong> If payment is made under these benefits, the insurance company is entitled to recover such amounts from other parties or persons. Any party or <strong>Cardholder </strong>who receives payment under these benefits must transfer to the insurance company his or her rights to recovery against any other party or person and must do everything necessary to secure these rights and must do nothing that would jeopardize them, or these rights will be recovered from the <strong>Cardholder</strong>. </p><p style="margin-left:5pt"><strong>Salvage</strong>: If an item is not repairable, the claim <strong>Administrator </strong>may request that the <strong>Cardholder </strong>or gift recipient send the item to the <strong>Administrator </strong>for salvage at the <strong>Cardholder’s </strong>or gift recipient’s expense. Failure to remit the requested item for salvage to the claim Administrator may result in denial of the claim.</p><p style="margin-left:5pt"><strong>Other Insurance:</strong> Coverage is secondary to and in excess of any other applicable insurance or indemnity available to You. Coverage is limited to only those amounts not covered by any other insurance or indemnity. It is subject to the conditions, limitations, and exclusions described in this document. In no event will this coverage apply as contributing insurance. This Other Insurance clause will take precedence over a similar clause found in other insurance or indemnity language. </p><p style="margin-left:5pt"><strong>Non-Contribution: </strong>In no event will these insurance benefits apply as contributing insurance. The non-contribution insurance clause will take precedence over the non-contribution clause found in any other insurance policies. </p><p style="margin-left:5pt"><strong>Severability of Provisions: </strong>If in the future any one or more of the provisions of this MasterRental Guide to Benefits is, to any extent and for any reason, held to be invalid or unenforceable, then such provision(s) shall be deemed &#34;severable&#34; from the remaining provisions of the Guide. In that event, all other provisions of this Guide shall remain valid and enforceable.
