<h4>Cash compensation:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Eligible <a href="../faq/index.html#whichtypesofpayrollcostsareeligibleforloanforgiveness" data-params="#whichtypesofpayrollcostsareeligibleforloanforgiveness" title="opens an FAQ in a new window">cash compensation</a> includes: gross salary, gross wages, gross tips, gross commissions, paid leave (vacation, family, medical or sick leave), and allowances for dismissal or separation. This may include bonus, hazard pay, and salaries to furloughed employees.</li>
<li>Do not include compensation in excess of an annual salary of $100,000 annualized, as prorated for the covered period. Therefore, the payroll schedule should show no employee with more than $46,154 in compensation if selecting a 24 week period - the maximums are lower for periods of less than 24 weeks.</li>
<li>Do not include payments to independent contractors, or compensation to employees whose principal place of residence is outside the US; or qualified sick and family leave wages for which a credit is allowed under sections 7001 and 7003 of the Families First Coronavirus Response Act.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Compensation to owners:<a name="compensationtoowners" id="compensationtoowners">⁠</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Owner-employees, self-employed individuals and partners are eligible for loan forgiveness on the basis of their 2019 compensation. The maximum amount of loan forgiveness you can claim as compensation per individual owner or partner is $20,833 (which is 2.5 months equivalent of $100,000 per year) - the maximums are lower for periods of less than 24 weeks.</li>
<li>Self-employed Schedule C (or Schedule F) filers. If you did not submit 2019 IRS Form 1040 Schedule C (or F) when you initially applied for the PPP loan, include it with your forgiveness application.</li>
<li>General Partners. If you are a partnership and did not submit 2019 IRS Form 1065 K-1s when you initially applied for the PPP loan, include it with the partnership’s forgiveness application.</li>
<li>For owner-employees of C-corps &amp; S-corps, to claim forgiveness, you must submit payroll documents detailing cash compensation paid to owner-employee(s) during the covered period selected, up to the eligible amount stated previously.</li>
<li>Owner-employees with less than 5% ownership stake in a C- or S-Corporation are not subject to the owner-employee compensation limits and are eligible for a maximum payroll claim of $46,154 in cash compensation if selecting a 24 week period - the maximums are lower for periods of less than 24 weeks.</li>
</ul> 

 <h4>Non-cash compensation:⁠ <a name="noteonnoncash" id="noteonnoncash">⁠</a></h4>
<p>The caps detailed relate to maximums that you can claim for cash compensation. In addition, borrowers may claim non-cash compensation for employer contributions for employee health insurance; employer contributions to employee retirement plans; and state and local taxes assessed on employee compensation, as explained in the <a href="../faq/index.html">FAQs</a>.</p>
<h4>Full-time equivalency (FTE):⁠<a name="noteonfte" id="noteonfte">⁠</a></h4>
<p>FTE counts both full-time (FT) and part-time (PT) employees. An FT employee is counted as 1.0 FTE, and a PT employee is counted by average number of hours per week divided by 40. For example, a PT employee working 32 hours would count as 0.8 FTE. The SBA also offers a simplified method that assigns all PT employees as 0.5 FTE, if that is preferable.</p>
