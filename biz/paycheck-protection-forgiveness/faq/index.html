 <h2>About the PPP loan and loan forgiveness</h2><div class="c58" id="whatarethetermsoftheloanandarethereanyfees" data-cid="tcm:84-199472-16" data-ctid="tcm:91-6213-32">
		<h3 class="c58question">What are the terms of the loan and are there any fees?</h3>	
		<div class="c58answer"><p>The term or period of the PPP loan is stated in your promissory note and is either two or five years. </p>
<p>The PPP loan will accrue interest at an annual rate of 1%.</p>
<p data-params="#whatisthedeferralperiod">No payment is due during the deferral period, which ends:</p>
<ol>
<li>On the date when the SBA makes a decision on your application for forgiveness, or;</li>
<li>10 months after the last day of the covered period, if you have not applied for forgiveness.</li>
</ol>
<p>If your loan is forgiven, any interest accrued during the deferral period is eligible for forgiveness.</p>
<p>There is no penalty for loan pre-payment, however partial or full pre-payment may impact forgiveness.</p>
<p>After the deferral period, any balance that is not forgiven (including any accrued interest on the unforgiven portion) will become a term loan with monthly payments due up to the maturity date and with an annual interest rate of 1%.</p>
<p>For each payment of principal, interest, and/or fees that has not been paid in full within 15 (fifteen) days after its due date, you will be assessed a late charge of $15 or five percent (5%) of the amount due, whichever is greater.</p>
<p>There are no annual or documentation fees associated with the loan. However, if you are late on payments after the deferral period, you may be liable for late fees for any portion of the loan that is not forgiven.</p>
<p>You will receive a loan statement before any payment is due, so you can plan accordingly.</p>
<p>Please refer to the <a href="../../../es/exit/e/index510f.html?id=2199194222" class="c28aLink" data-cid="tcm:84-199472-16" data-ctid="tcm:91-6213-32">SBA</a> site for more details on the covered period, the term of the loan and other loan forgiveness details.</p></div>

		<h3 class="c58question">What is the deferral period?</h3>	
		<div class="c58answer"><p>Your deferral period ends: </p>
<ol>
<li>On the date when the SBA makes a decision on your application for forgiveness, or;</li>
<li>10 months after the last day of the covered period, if you have not applied for forgiveness.</li>
</ol>
<p>No payment of PPP loan principal, interest, and fees is due during the deferral period. </p>
<p>If you received your promissory note before June 5, 2020, it may indicate that your first payment is due 6 months from the date of the note. The PPP Flexibility Act (signed on June 5, 2020) extended the deferral period, so you can disregard the original 6 month period referenced in the promissory note.</p>
<p>You will receive a loan statement before any payment is due, so you can plan accordingly.</p></div>

		<h3 class="c58question">What are Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDL) and advances and how do they affect loan forgiveness?</h3>	
		<div class="c58answer"><p>Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDL) are direct loans, while EIDL advances are grants. The SBA set the maximum EIDL advance at $10,000. EIDL <em><strong>advances</strong></em> will no longer be deducted by the SBA from forgiveness amounts. You may be able to refinance EIDL loans funded between 1/31/2020 and 4/3/2020 with your first PPP loan. You cannot refinance an EIDL loan with a Second Draw PPP Loan. For any questions related to the SBA EIDL program, or to obtain an EIDL loan payoff amount, contact the SBA Disaster Loan Servicing Center at (800) 736-6048 or refer to the <strong><a href="../../../es/exit/e/indexa130.html?id=3199194222" class="c28aLink" data-cid="tcm:84-199473-16" data-ctid="tcm:91-6213-32">SBA</a></strong>.</p></div>

		<h3 class="c58question">Are PPP loans eligible for loan forgiveness?</h3>	
		<div class="c58answer"><p>PPP loans, in whole or in part, are eligible for loan forgiveness if funds were used for certain eligible business expenses. However, if you pay off your loan in full before you apply for forgiveness, you are no longer eligible for loan forgiveness. If part of the loan is not forgiven, you will be responsible to repay the amount not forgiven plus any accrued interest.

		<h3 class="c58question">How does a change in ownership (e.g. merger, asset sale, stock sale, or transfer due to the death of a business owner) affect my PPP loan or loan forgiveness?</h3>	
		<div class="c58answer"><p>If you are considering a change of ownership for your business, which could include a merger, asset sale, stock sale or transfer due to the death of a business owner, please notify Wells Fargo as far in advance of the change of ownership transaction as possible. You will need to request prior approval from Wells Fargo before you initiate the change of ownership and provide a copy of the proposed change of ownership agreement and other relevant documents. If you do not obtain prior approval of any change of ownership, it will be considered a default event and may affect your ability to apply for PPP loan forgiveness.</p>
<p>To contact us about a change in ownership if you are a Wells Fargo Business Online<sup>®</sup> user or a Wealth &amp; Investment Management customer, please call <span class="c12">1-844-304-8911</span>. We will work with you to complete the process as quickly as possible, but we cannot make any assurances regarding the exact timing for completion of your request, due to the many variables involved.</p>
<p>Providing the requested documentation and responding to questions quickly ensures the best outcome. We anticipate that it will likely take a minimum of 30 days to fully complete the request. The timeframe will depend on our evaluation, your responsiveness during each step of the process, and applicable SBA requirements.</p></div>

		<div class="c58answer"><p data-params="#whatisthecoveredperiod">To be eligible for loan forgiveness, the funds must be used for eligible costs incurred or paid during the <a href="index.html#whatisthecoveredperiod" title="Opens another FAQ on this page" data-params="#whatisthecoveredperiod">covered period</a>. You can choose a covered period of any length between 8-weeks (56 days) and 24-weeks (168 days), beginning on the date you received the loan proceeds.</p>
<p>Cost include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Eligible payroll costs, including compensation to owners and employee benefits</li>
<li>Interest payments on business mortgage obligations on real or personal property, where the mortgage originated before February 15, 2020, (but not any payment of principal or prepayment of interest)</li>
<li>Business rent or lease payments for real or personal property, where the rent or lease agreement was in force before February 15, 2020</li>
<li>Business utility payments for a service such as electricity, gas, water, transportation, telephone, or internet access for which service began before February 15, 2020</li>
</ul>
<p>Additional eligible costs were added as part of the Economic Aid to Hard-Hit Small Businesses, Nonprofits, and Venues Act, signed into law on December 27, 2020. These eligible costs are retroactive to any previous unforgiven PPP loans and include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Covered operations expenditure. Payment for any software or cloud computing service that facilitates business operations, product or service delivery, human resources, or accounting, among other things.</li>
<li>Covered property damage cost. Cost related to property damage and vandalism or looting due to public disturbances that occurred during 2020 that was not covered by insurance.</li>
<li>Covered supplier cost. Expenditure to a supplier of goods for the supply of goods that are essential to operations when the expenditure is made and is made pursuant to a contract, order, or purchase order in effect prior to taking out the loan. With respect to perishable goods, the contract, order, or purchase order must be in effect at any time during the covered period.</li>
<li>Covered worker protection expenditure. Operating or capital expenditure to facilitate the adaptation of business activities to comply with requirements or guidance issued by federal, state, or local authorities in relation to COVID-19, including personal protective equipment.</li>

		<h3 class="c58question">What is the covered period?</h3>	
		<div class="c58answer"><p>The covered period is the period in which loan funds must be used to qualify for loan forgiveness. You can choose a covered period of any length between 8-weeks (56 days) and 24-weeks (168 days), beginning on the date you received the loan proceeds.</p>
<p>Funds must be used for eligible costs incurred during the covered period. </p>
<p>Payroll costs for the covered period must be paid or incurred during the period to be eligible. If payroll costs are incurred during the last pay period within the covered period selected, but paid after the end of the covered period selected (but on or before the next regular payroll date), these payroll costs will still be eligible for forgiveness. (For example, this may happen when your pay cycle ended on the payday of Friday, October 2, but the covered period selected ended on October 1.)</p></div>
	</div><div class="c58" id="whichtypesofpayrollcostsareeligibleforloanforgiveness" data-cid="tcm:84-199481-16" data-ctid="tcm:91-6213-32">
		<h3 class="c58question">Which types of payroll costs are eligible for loan forgiveness?</h3>	
		<div class="c58answer"><p>Eligible payroll costs include the following, if paid or incurred during the covered period:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gross salary, gross wages, gross tips, gross commissions, paid leave (vacation, family, medical or sick leave, not including leave covered by the Families First Coronavirus Response Act), and allowances for dismissal or separation;</li>
<li>Payments for employer contributions for employee health insurance, including employer contributions to a self-insured, employer-sponsored group health plan, but excluding any pre-tax or after-tax contributions by employees;</li>
<li>Payments for employer contributions to employee retirement plans, excluding any pre-tax or after-tax contributions by employees;</li>
<li>Payments for employer state and local taxes assessed on employee compensation (such as state unemployment insurance tax), excluding any taxes withheld from employee earnings;</li>
<li>Payroll costs may include bonus and hazard pay, and may include salaries paid to furloughed employees.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Limitations for individual employees</strong></h4>
<p>The total amount of cash compensation eligible for forgiveness may not exceed a pro-rated annual salary of $100,000. This means the maximum you can claim for cash compensation is $46,154 for any individual employee during a 24-week covered period - the maximums are lower for periods of less than 24 weeks.</p>
<p>Eligible payroll costs are limited to employees whose principal place of residence is the United States. Payments to independent contractors are not eligible. </p>
<p>These caps relate to maximums that you can claim for cash compensation. In addition, borrowers may claim non-cash compensation for employer contributions for employee health insurance; employer contributions to employee retirement plans; and state and local taxes assessed on employee compensation, as explained in these FAQs.</p>
<h4>Limitations for owner-employees, self-employed, and general partners </h4>
<p>Compensation for owner-employees, self-employed individuals and general partners are also eligible for loan forgiveness based on certain PPP compensation formulas, and based on their business type. </p>
<p>For PPP, an owner-employee is defined as an owner who is also an employee (including where the owner is the only employee). Owner-employees with a less than 5% ownership stake in a C-corps or S-corps are not subject to the owner-employee compensation limitation. </p>
<p>Owner compensation falls under “Payroll costs”, and for a 24-week covered period it is capped at the lesser of 2.5 months of $100,000 annualized ($20,833) or 2.5 months of compensation, in the year that was used to calculate the loan amount (2019 or 2020) across all businesses in which they have an ownership stake - the maximums are lower for periods of less than 24 weeks. The PPP compensation formulas varies based on business type, as explained: </p>
<h4>For self-employed individuals</h4>
<p>If filing IRS 1040 Schedule C (or Schedule F), forgiveness is capped at 2.5 times the monthly net profit/loss in the year that was used to calculate the loan amount (2019 or 2020), as shown on Schedule C, line 31 (or Schedule F, line 34). Note that if your net profit in the year that was used to calculate the loan amount (2019 or 2020) was a net loss, the forgiveness amount will be zero.
<br /></p>
<h4>For general partners</h4>
<p>Forgiveness is capped at 2.5 months x the monthly self-employment earnings in the year that was used to calculate the loan amount (2019 or 2020) and as shown on IRS 1065 Schedule K-1 line 14a (reduced by Sec. 179 deduction, unreimbursed partnership expenses, and depletion from oil and gas properties) and multiplied by 0.9235, subject to a maximum of $20,833 per owner for a 24-week covered period - the maximums are lower for periods of less than 24 weeks. Only compensation paid during the covered period is eligible for loan forgiveness. Documentation of such payments do not need to be provided to the lender.</p>
<p>No additional forgiveness is available for retirement or health insurance contributions for self-employed individuals or general partners. </p>
<p>If you are in a general partnership and did not submit 2019 IRS Form 1065 K-1s when you initially applied for the PPP loan, you will need to include it with your forgiveness application. </p>
<h4>For owner-employees of S-corps</h4>
<p>The employee cash compensation of an S-corp owner-employee, defined as an owner who is also an employee, is also eligible for loan forgiveness up to a maximum of 2.5 months x their monthly employee cash compensation in the year that was used to calculate the loan amount (2019 or 2020). As explained previously, for a 24-week covered period the maximum forgiveness is $20,833 per owner - the maximums are lower for periods of less than 24 weeks.</p>
<p>You can also claim forgiveness for payments for employer state and local taxes paid by the borrower and assessed on the owner-employee’s compensation, and for employer retirement contributions to owner-employee retirement plan capped at the amount of 2.5x their monthly employer retirement contribution in the year that was used to calculate the loan amount (2019 or 2020). </p>
<p>These eligible non-cash compensation payments should be included on lines 7 and 8 of PPP Schedule A, Form 3508 or line 1 of Form 3508EZ, and do not count toward the $20,833 cap per individual owner. If you use Form 3508S, you will enter all eligible payroll and nonpayroll costs on a single line. </p>
<p>Employer contributions for health insurance are not eligible for additional forgiveness for S-corp employees having at least a 2% stake in the business. </p>
<p>To claim forgiveness, you must submit payroll documents detailing cash compensation paid to owner-employee(s) during the covered period selected, up to the eligible amount stated previously. Payments other than for cash compensation should be included on lines 6 through 8 of PPP Schedule A of the loan forgiveness application and do not count toward the $20,833 cap per individual. </p>
<h4>For owner-employees of C-corps</h4>
<p>The employee cash compensation of a C-corp owner-employee, defined as an owner who is also an employee, is eligible for loan forgiveness up a maximum of 2.5 x their monthly employee cash compensation in the year that was used to calculate the loan amount (2019 or 2020). For a 24-week covered period the maximum forgiveness is $20,833 per owner - the maximums are lower for periods of less than 24 weeks.</p>
<p>You can also claim forgiveness for payments for employer state and local taxes paid by the borrower and assessed on owner-employee compensation, for the amount paid by the borrower for employer contributions for owner-employee health insurance, and for employer retirement contributions to owner-employee retirement plan capped at the amount of 2.5x their monthly employer retirement contribution in the year that was used to calculate the loan amount (2019 or 2020). </p>
<p>To claim forgiveness, you must submit payroll documents detailing cash compensation paid to owner-employee(s) during the covered period selected, up to the eligible amount stated previously. Payments other than for cash compensation should be included on lines 6 through 8 of PPP Schedule A, of Form 3508 or line 1 of Form 3508EZ, and do not count toward the $20,833 cap per individual. If you use Form 3508S, you will enter all eligible payroll and nonpayroll costs on a single line.</p>
<h4>In all cases</h4>
<p>Owner compensation for a 24-week covered period is capped $20,833 (not to exceed 2.5 months of compensation in the year that was used to calculate the loan amount (2019 or 2020) across all businesses in which they have an ownership stake - the maximums are lower for periods of less than 24 weeks. Note that owner-employees with less than 5% ownership stake in C-or S-corps are not subject to these caps, but are still subject to the general employee limitation of $46,154 per employee during a 24-week covered period - the maximums are lower for periods of less than 24 weeks.</p>
<p>These caps relate to maximums that you can claim for cash compensation. In addition, borrowers may claim non-cash compensation for employer contributions for employee health insurance; employer contributions to employee retirement plans; and state and local taxes assessed on employee compensation, as explained in these FAQs.</p></div>

<p>For a 24-week covered period, the maximum amount of loan forgiveness you can claim as compensation for owner-employees, self-employed individuals and general partners is the lower of 2.5 months of compensation earned in the year that was used to calculate the loan amount (2019 or 2020) or $20,833, which is the 2.5-month equivalent of $100,000 per year - the maximums are lower for periods of less than 24 weeks. </p>

		<h3 class="c58question">Are there possible reductions to my PPP loan forgiveness amount?</h3>	
		<div class="c58answer"><p>Forgiveness is based in part on maintaining employees and maintaining wages paid, or rehiring and reinstating employee wage levels, if previously reduced. To maximize forgiveness, you may choose to rehire and restore wages sooner to increase eligible payroll costs that fall into the covered period. </p>
<p>If you had a reduction in full-time equivalency (FTE) or wage level, your forgiveness amount may be reduced. You may be exempt from these reductions if you restored FTE and wage levels on or before December 31, 2020 (or, for a PPP loan made after December 27, 2020, the last day of the Covered Period).

		<h3 class="c58question">What does full-time equivalency (FTE) employee mean?</h3>	
		<div class="c58answer"><p>Full-time equivalency (FTE) employee generally means an employee who works 40 hours or more, on average, each week. For part-time employees who work less than 40 hours, calculate their FTE as a proportion of 40 hours. For example, if an employee worked 32 hours per week on average, the employee should be counted as 0.8 FTE. Alternatively, SBA offers a simplified method that assigns all part-time employee as 0.5, if that is preferable.</p>
<p>Only employees whose place of residence is in the United States should be included.</p>
<p>When counting FTE reductions, you will not be penalized for: </p>
<ul>
<li>A position for which you made a good-faith, written offer to rehire an employee during the covered period selected and the offer was rejected – subject to certain requirements</li>
<li>An employee who was fired for cause, voluntarily resigned, or voluntarily requested a reduction of their hours, during the covered period selected</li>
<li>A documented inability to rehire particular employees or hire replacement employees for unfilled positions</li>
<li>A documented inability to return to normal business activities because of COVID related safety requirements</li>
</ul>

		<h3 class="c58question">How would an FTE reduction affect my PPP loan forgiveness?</h3>	
		<div class="c58answer"><p>In general, your loan forgiveness is reduced by the same percentage as the percentage reduction in FTE employees. This is calculated by comparing the average weekly FTE employees during the covered period with the FTE reduction reference period selected. </p>
<p>For example, if you had 10.0 FTE employees during the FTE reduction reference period and this declined to 8.0 FTE employees during the covered period, the percentage of FTE employees declined by 20%, and therefore only 80% of otherwise eligible expenses will be forgiven.</p>

<p>When calculating FTE reduction, you must include all employees (including those earning more than $100,000).</p>
<p>If you've terminated an employee during the covered period, your FTE count will be impacted if you don’t rehire them or don’t have an exemption reason. If an employee was terminated for cause, voluntarily resigned, or voluntarily requested a reduction of hours, you may count that employee at the same FTE level as before.</p></div>

		<h3 class="c58question">If I had a reduction in employees’ salary or wages, or terminated an employee, how does that affect my PPP loan forgiveness?</h3>	
		<div class="c58answer"><p>Loan forgiveness may be reduced when there was a reduction in an employee’s salary or wages from January 1, 2020 to March 31, 2020, (the salary reduction reference period) in excess of 25%, unless an exception applies. There is a salary or hourly wage reduction safe harbor if you restored salary/wage levels on or before December 31, 2020 (or, for a PPP loan made after December 27, 2020, the last day of the Covered Period).
<br /></p>
<p>For each person employed during the covered period selected, start with the employee’s average annual salary or hourly wage during the covered period selected, and calculate whether that employee had a reduction in excess of 25% compared to the salary reduction reference period. Do not count the salary reduction for employees who were already counted in the FTE reduction.</p>
<p>For more details on the salary reduction calculations, please refer to the directions on page 4 of <a href="../../../es/exit/e/index0a44.html?id=5199194222" class="c28aLink" data-cid="tcm:84-199492-16" data-ctid="tcm:91-6213-32">Form 3508 Loan Forgiveness Application Instructions</a>. No salary reduction calculations are required if you’re using Form 3508S or Form 3508EZ.</p>
<p>This salary reduction penalty does not apply for any employee who was paid more than an annualized equivalent of $100,000 in any pay period in the year that was used to calculate the loan amount (2019 or 2020). </p>
<p>In summary, if the average annual salary or hourly wage for each employee working during the covered period selected was at least 75% of their average annual salary or hourly wage in the salary reduction reference period, there is no salary/hourly wage reduction.</p></div>

<p>No payment of PPP loan principal, interest, and fees is due during the deferral period. </p>
<p>If you received your promissory note before June 5, 2020, it may indicate that your first payment is due 6 months from the date of the note. The PPP Flexibility Act (signed on June 5, 2020) extended the deferral period, so you can disregard the original 6 month period referenced in the promissory note.</p>
<p>You will receive a loan statement before any payment is due, so you can plan accordingly.</p>
<h4>Once the Wells Fargo PPP loan forgiveness online application is available</h4>
<p>Eligible customers will be able to start their loan forgiveness application online and upload the <a href="../supporting-documents/index.html">recommended supporting documents</a>.</p>
<p>The only way to apply for forgiveness for a PPP loan from Wells Fargo is either by using the Wells Fargo online forgiveness application (accessible through Wells Fargo Business Online<sup>®</sup>) or through the SBA PPP Direct Forgiveness Portal. To facilitate the forgiveness process, the SBA has developed a suite of resources available on their website, including instructional videos designed to guide borrowers through each step of the forgiveness application process. </p>
<p>Although you can apply for forgiveness at any time, to maximize PPP loan forgiveness, you'll want to make sure you have utilized the funds for eligible costs within the covered period. You'll need to calculate salary reduction conditions for the entire covered period, and should be ready to provide documentation for all your eligible expenses when you complete your application.</p>
<p>Be prepared to provide documentation for all your eligible expenses when you complete your application.</p>
<p>You have until the maturity date of the loan to apply for loan forgiveness. However, there are things you may want to consider before deciding when to apply:</p>
<ul>
<li>To get full forgiveness, make sure you have used all your PPP funds for eligible costs. You have up to 24 weeks to do so.</li>
<li>When you submit a loan forgiveness application and the SBA notifies Wells Fargo of the loan forgiveness amount, or that the loan is not eligible for forgiveness, your payment deferral period will end. At that point, loan payments on any amount not forgiven, including any interest, will become due and you will need to start making monthly payments, if applicable. You will receive a loan statement before any payment is due, so you can plan accordingly.</li>
<li>If you have repaid your loan in full before submitting a loan forgiveness application, you will not be eligible for forgiveness. Partial repayment may also affect forgiveness.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will continue to keep you updated on key dates by email and on this site, as you continue through the forgiveness process. If you applied on the SBA's Direct Forgiveness Portal, you can see the status of your forgiveness application through their portal.

<div class="c58" id="whatisthegrossreceiptsreductioncalculationandwhenwilliberequiredtouseit" data-cid="tcm:84-218815-16" data-ctid="tcm:91-6213-32">
		<h3 class="c58question">What is the Gross Receipts Reduction Calculation and when will I be required to use it?</h3>	
		<div class="c58answer"><p>The Gross Receipts Reduction Calculation is used to determine whether your business experienced a reduction in gross receipts of at least 25%. This is a requirement for all Second Draw PPP Loans.</p>
<p>If you did not provide this information when you applied for your Second Draw PPP Loan, you will be asked to provide details and supporting documentation when you apply for forgiveness.</p>
<p>To calculate Gross Receipts Reduction, you will be asked to select the Time Period you experienced the 25% reduction in gross receipts in 2020 and identify the corresponding Reference Time Period you wish to use as a comparison. You will need to state the gross receipts amounts for both time periods, as well as provide supporting documentation. Your supporting documentation must match both time periods you chose and substantiate the 25% gross receipts reduction.</p>
<p>For all loans, the appropriate Reference Time Period depends on how long you have been in operation: </p>
<ul>
<li>Unless you meet one of the conditions below, you must demonstrate that gross receipts in any calendar quarter of 2020 were at least 25 percent lower than the same quarter of 2019 OR you may compare annual gross receipts in 2020 with annual gross receipts in 2019 if you were in business in 2019.</li>
<li>If you were not in business during the first and second quarters of 2019 but were in operation during the third and fourth quarters of 2019, you must demonstrate that gross receipts in any quarter of 2020 were at least 25 percent lower than during either the third or fourth quarters of 2019. </li>
<li>If you were not in business during the first, second, and third quarters of 2019 but were in operation during the fourth quarter of 2019, you must demonstrate that gross receipts in any quarter of 2020 were at least 25 percent lower than the fourth quarter of 2019. </li>
<li>If you were not in business during 2019 but were in operation on February 15, 2020, you must demonstrate that gross receipts in the second, third, or fourth quarter of 2020 were at least 25 percent lower than the first quarter of 2020. </li>
</ul>
<p>Gross receipts are generally defined as:</p>
<p>For a for-profit business, all revenue in whatever form received or accrued (in accordance with the entity’s accounting method, i.e., accrual or cash) from whatever source, including from the sales of products or services, interest, dividends, rents, royalties, fees, or commissions, reduced by returns and allowances but excluding net capital gains and losses. These terms carry the definitions used and reported on IRS tax return forms.</p>
<p>Gross receipts do not include the following: </p>
<ul>
<li>taxes collected for and remitted to a taxing authority if included in gross or total income, such as sales or other taxes collected from customers (this does not include taxes levied on the concern or its employees); </li>
<li>proceeds from transactions between a concern and its domestic or foreign affiliates; and </li>
<li>amounts collected for another by a travel agent, real estate agent, advertising agent, conference management service provider, freight forwarder or customs broker. </li>
</ul>
<p>All other items, such as subcontractor costs, reimbursements for purchases a contractor makes at a customer’s request, investment income, and employee-based costs such as payroll taxes, may not be excluded from gross receipts. </p>
<p>For a nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization, a 501(c)(19) veterans organization, an eligible nonprofit news organization, an eligible 501(c)(6) organization, or an eligible destination marketing organization, gross receipts means gross receipts within the meaning of section 6033 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, which is the gross amount received by the organization during its annual accounting period from all sources without reduction for any costs or expenses including, for example, cost of goods or assets sold, cost of operations, or expenses of earning, raising, or collecting such amounts. Thus “gross receipts” includes, but is not limited to: </p>
<ul>
<li>the gross amount received as contributions, gifts, grants, and similar amounts without reduction for the expenses of raising and collecting such amounts, </li>
<li>the gross amount received as dues or assessments from members or affiliated organizations without reduction for expenses attributable to the receipt of such amounts, </li>
<li>gross sales or receipts from business activities (including business activities unrelated to the purpose for which the organization qualifies for exemption, the net income or loss from which may be required to be reported on Form 990-T), </li>
<li>the gross amount received from the sale of assets without reduction for cost or other basis and expenses of sale, and </li>
<li>the gross amount received as investment income, such as interest, dividends, rents, and royalties.</li>
</ul>
<p>Gross receipts of an affiliate (unless a waiver of affiliation applies) are calculated by adding the gross receipts of the business concern with the gross receipts of each affiliate.</p></div>

		<h3 class="c58question">Which loan forgiveness application should I complete?</h3>	
		<div class="c58answer"><p>There are three PPP loan forgiveness applications, Form 3508S, Form 3508EZ, and Form 3508. You should use the form that best meets your circumstances. </p>
<p>If you have a loan of $150,000 or less, consider using Form 3508S, this simple form requires you to provide less information and the processing time may also be shorter than other forms.</p>
<p>If you are not eligible for Form 3508S, consider using Form 3508EZ, this form requires fewer calculations, may call for less documentation than Form 3508, and does not require you to reduce your loan forgiveness calculations if you have reduced FTE or salaries. Only consider using Form 3508EZ if you meet one of the following conditions:</p>
<h4>Salaries and the number of employees and hours were not reduced during the covered period</h4>
<p>You did not reduce annual salary or hourly wages of any employee by more than 25 percent during the covered period compared to the most recent full quarter before the Covered Period. (For purposes of this statement, “employees” means only those employees that did not receive, during any single period during the year that was used to calculate the loan amount (2019 or 2020), wages or salary at an annualized rate of pay in an amount more than $100,000); </p>
<p>AND</p>
<p>You did not reduce the number of employees or the average paid hours of employees between January 1, 2020 and the end of the covered period. (Ignore reductions that arose from an inability to rehire individuals who were employees on February 15, 2020 if you were unable to hire similarly qualified employees for unfilled positions on or before December 31, 2020 (or for a PPP loan made after December 27, 2020, the last day of the Covered Period). Also, ignore reductions in an employee’s hours that you offered to restore and the employee refused). See 85 FR 33004, 33007 (June 1, 2020) for more details. </p>
<p>Or </p>
<h4>Salaries were not reduced and unable to return to same level of business activity during the covered period</h4>
<p>You did not reduce annual salary or hourly wages of any employee by more than 25 percent during the covered period compared to the most recent full quarter before the Covered Period. (For purposes of this statement, “employees” means only those employees that did not receive, during any single period during 2019, wages or salary at an annualized rate of pay in an amount more than $100,000.);
<br /></p>
<p>AND </p>
<p>You were unable to operate during the covered period at the same level of business activity as before February 15, 2020, due to compliance with requirements established or guidance issued between March 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020 (or, for a PPP loan made after December 27, 2020, requirements established or guidance issued between March 1, 2020 and the last day of the Covered Period) by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, related to the maintenance of standards of sanitation, social distancing, or any other work or customer safety requirement related to COVID-19.

<p>If your application for PPP loan forgiveness is only partially approved, an email will be sent to you with instructions on how to request a SBA Loan Review of your Partial Forgiveness decision if you are eligible. It is at your discretion if you want to request a SBA Loan Review of your Partial Forgiveness decision. The SBA reserves the right to review the partial approval decision in its sole discretion.</p>
<p>If you plan to request a SBA Loan Review, you must do so within 30 calendar days of receiving the email or you will not be eligible.</p>
<p>Please note that the SBA Loan Review may determine that you are entitled to forgiveness in an amount less than what Wells Fargo decided (including zero if, for example, it is determined you are ineligible for the PPP loan), an amount more than what Wells Fargo decided, or the same amount as Wells Fargo decided.</p>
<p>If the SBA selects your loan for an SBA Loan Review as a result of your request, please continue to make payments on the remaining balance of your loan. Your loan payments will not be deferred during the SBA Loan Review.</p>
<p>If you are not satisfied with the findings of an SBA Loan Review decision, you may be able to appeal that decision to the SBA Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA). If your loan is eligible for an appeal, details on how to appeal will be included with the SBA Loan Review decision. For additional details on the SBA Loan Review &amp; Appeal process, please refer to the <a href="../../../es/exit/e/index97f8.html?id=16199194222" class="c28aLink" data-cid="tcm:84-213645-16" data-ctid="tcm:91-6213-32">SBA guidance on Appeals of SBA Loan Review Decisions Under the Paycheck Protection Program</a>.</p></div>

		<h3 class="c58question">When and how do I start making payments, and can I still apply for forgiveness if I have already started making payments on my PPP loan?</h3>	
		<div class="c58answer"><p>If you submit your loan forgiveness application within 10 months of the end of the covered period, you will not have to make any payments of principal or interest on your loan before the date on which the SBA makes a final decision on the loan forgiveness amount. Once the SBA makes a final decision, your deferral period is over and you will be required to repay any unforgiven portion of the loan, plus any accrued interest on that portion. You will not be required to pay back any of the forgiven amount and associated interest. Once you are required to start making payments, you will receive a monthly statement, which includes details on when your payment is due and how to make the payment.</p>
<p>If you’d like to make a complete payoff of your PPP loan and are using Wells Fargo Business Online<sup>®</sup> or you are a Wealth &amp; Investment Management customer, please call <span class="c12">1-844-304-8911</span>. If you would like a letter confirming the payoff of your loan, you may request one at the time of payment or afterwards using the same contact numbers provided. Customers requesting a complete payoff of their PPP loan will be responsible for paying all outstanding principal as well as any accrued interest. If you pay off your loan in full, before you apply for forgiveness, you are no longer eligible for loan forgiveness.</p>
<p>If you have started making payments towards your PPP loan, but have an outstanding balance, you are still eligible to apply for PPP loan forgiveness. Additionally, any payments made towards your PPP loan balance prior to the date you submit your loan forgiveness application may be returned to you, if loan forgiveness is approved, up to the approved loan forgiveness amount.</p></div>
